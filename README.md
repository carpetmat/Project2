Project 2 Report

Meteorology Instrument Package Assignment


For this project, I was tasked with analyzing data from the OOI website. In this case the data assigned was 1 years worth of data for the following two instruments:

Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring
Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring

For this project I will be performing the following tasks, and answering their subsequent questions:

For each site:
Plot wind speed (in m/w)
Rain rate (in mm/hr)
Plot and show the following time windows:
when it is windy and rainy
when it is rainy but not windy
when it is windy but not rainy
when it is not windy and not rainy.

Plot the cross-correlation function between wind speed at both sites:
What is the highest correlation?

The highests correlation was between the wind speed at both sites, with a correlation of 0.71.


What is the time lag?

Exactly 0 seconds. Which would make sense, since likely wind covers a vast area. I bet this data might have been more interesting if I instead looked at wind direction, rather than overall wind speed.


Plot the cross-correlation function between rain rate at both sites:
What is the highest correlation?

The highests correlation was between the wind speed at both sites, with a correlation of 0.528.

        

What is the time lag?

The time lag was a very interesting 52 minutes and 33 seconds. Which also makes sense to me as rain clouds may be transported over a distance by the wind. However a more thorough data analysis will need to be done to confirm this.


Is there any relationship between the time lag of wind speed and rain rate?

There does not appear to be a relationship between wind speed and rain rate. But I did not think to perform a cross-correlation between the two data sets. Had I the time, I would like to have tried this.


Calculate and plot the monthly average of the wind speed and rain rate for each site
What pattern do you see? Explain!

        For both Wind and Rain, it appears that there are high points in January, April, and September, by the in between months
        are much lower. With the Exception of for Rain, where rain picks up by a lot in December.


        Wind appears highest on average for the offshore profiler, while Rain appears highest on average for the Shelf profiler.
        My presumption would be that this makes sense, as wind has less obstruction far out on the water. It’s been too long since
        my last science lesson regarding precipitation however to make any sort of reasonable presumption.


Which month had the highest rain rate?
                        

                For the OSSM, there is a rough tie for highest rain rate in January, September, and December.

                For the OOSM, December by far had the highest rain rate.

                        

Which month had the lowest rain rate?
                        

                In both cases, it was easily August that had the lowest rain rate

        

Which month had the highest wind speed?

                For the OSSM: January

                For the OOSM: October

                        

Which month had the lowest wind speed?

                For the OSSM: August

                For the OOSM: September
